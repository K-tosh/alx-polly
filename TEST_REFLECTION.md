AI-assisted tests: reflection

What worked
- Extracting `validateCreatePoll` into `app/lib/validation.ts` made unit tests trivial and fast.
- Vitest + RTL setup with `jsdom` and a `vitest.setup.ts` provided a smooth developer experience.
- Mocking `useAuth` in the integration test avoided async auth loading and enabled rendering behind `ProtectedRoute`.

What didn’t
- Initial coverage run failed due to missing `@vitest/coverage-v8` and PowerShell piping. Installing the plugin and avoiding `| cat` fixed it.
- React 17 automatic JSX import assumptions caused “React is not defined” in several files. Adding explicit `import React from 'react'` resolved it in client files and tests.
- Mocking the whole `AuthProvider` first via Supabase was brittle and noisy. A direct `useAuth` mock was cleaner.

What surprised me
- UI component files achieved high coverage automatically due to simple render paths during the integration test.
- The loading state from `ProtectedRoute` fully masked the page until auth was mocked, reminding how crucial provider state is for integration tests.

Edited test for clarity
- Strengthened assertions in `CreatePollPage.int.test.tsx` by verifying console side-effect and form reset, improving signal beyond just the success alert.
